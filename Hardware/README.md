# Hardware Designs

This directory contains hardware designs for various modules that can be used to build a working solder reflow hotplate. The intent is to design different parts of an overall design separately and then combine them to produce a working unit. The goals of this approach are:

  - Collect the best ideas for common elements in one place for people to find and use.
  - Allow for different hardware decisions for different users to meet their individual needs or desires.
  - Provide examples for how different parts of an overall design may be combined in different ways and with different power supplies, microcontrollers, sensors, interfaces and other components.

# Tools

The designs in this subdirectory are currently maintained in KiCad 7.0.
